##Question 1
You are developing a simulation for a factory product line. How would you represent the conveyor belt where items move along the production line?
Wtite code to simulate a conveyor belt using your knowledge in data structures where items are added and removed from t as they enter and exit the conveyor belt.


##Question 2
Create an algorithm to efficiently allocate virtual machines (vms) to pysical servers in data center environment. This system needs to optimize resource usage accroess servers, reduce power consumption, and minimize the latency between dependent VMs. The challenge includes handling VM migrations to balance load without causing significant performance degration, adhering to data security and locality requriments, and predicating resource needs based on usage patterns.
